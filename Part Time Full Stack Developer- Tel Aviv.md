<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1537345894/press-kit/brand/logo-black.png" width="100" alt="Snyk logo" />

We are looking for a curious, capable developer to join our team and help us build our core [product](https://snyk.io/test).

In this role, you will own the development process of specific features in our SaaS offering on our Container Security team. You'll engage in problem analysis and create feature plans that outline implementation details. You'll code and build features in cross-functional feature teams. You'll work in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace with flexible part time hours, including remote work and working from the office periodically. You'll take part in maintaining and supporting our service.

### Responsibilities

#### Participate in feature decomposition

With our product and UX requirements at hand, you will take part in planning an impactful solution. We believe that _done_ is better than _perfect_. We iterate quite fast with a completely continuous deployment pipeline. You and your feature team will create a plan by combining the product requirements with the system's architecture. You will then take part in the review of this plan with relevant stakeholders, and off we go!

#### Code

Most of the time you will be coding :)
We run a flat and flexible team that groups around features at the beginning of each two-weeks' sprint. We use our flexibility to gather the right passion and talent around each feature we build. The ad-hoc feature team starts from the feature plan and adjusts it to its strengths, the feature impact and timelines. Keep your eyes on the demo at the end of the sprint, and track user engagement once released!

#### Engage with the full time team

As a part time developer, you will start the role with a more intensive onboarding as time allows, preferrably a few full time days at our offices in Tel Aviv, following with a more flexible schedule, of 2-3 days a week with flexible hour and in remote or in office work as you'd like, accommodating exams periods.
You will engage with the full time team members during design and review stages, with full ownership of the code you write.

### You should apply if:
* You're comfortable with Git, GitHub
* You've interested in working on delievering SaaS web application
* You've interested in working on Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment workflows
* You believe testing and code quality are important, and prioritise useful code review
* You like to move quickly and iteratively, and believe that shipping early is best
* You communicate proactively, and enjoy working in cross-functional delivery teams
* You like to start new things, see them through to production, and learn from your mistakes
* You're interested in security, developer tooling, and open source

We mostly work in JavaScript, both front-end and back-end, and our architecture follows the microservices pattern. We are very happy to help you learn if you don't have previous experience with these - we believe curiosity, communication, and the ability to learn are most important.

### Interested?

Please apply [here](fill in Greenhouse link). You'll be primarily based in our Tel Aviv office, on Rothschild, with flexibility to work remotely.

We value diversity at Snyk, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether youâ€™re the right person, do apply anyway or reach out to us.
